        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh, born on September 28, 1907, was a pivotal figure in
          India's fight for independence from British colonial rule. A
          revolutionary and a martyr, his life, filled with extraordinary
          courage and unyielding dedication to the cause of freedom, continues
          to inspire millions.
        </p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Born in Banga, now in Pakistan, Bhagat Singh was influenced by his
          familyâ€™s political involvement from an early age. His father and uncle
          were active in India's independence movement, and this shaped his
          desire to fight for freedom.
        </p>

        <h2>The Revolutionary Spirit</h2>
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh believed in complete independence, rejecting colonial
          reforms. He became a member of the Hindustan Socialist Republican
          Association (HSRA) and used armed resistance to fight for India's
          freedom. Notable events include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The assassination of British officer John Saunders in 1928, in
            revenge for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Central Legislative Assembly bombing in 1929, aimed at
            protesting oppressive British laws.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Trial and Martyrdom</h2>
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh and his comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev were hanged on March
          23, 1931. His death marked him as a national hero, and his courage
          continues to inspire generations.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh remains a symbol of the Indian independence movement. His
          thoughts on revolution, socialism, and freedom from oppression live
          on. His famous quotes include:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "It is easy to kill individuals, but you cannot kill ideas. Great
          empires crumbled, while the ideas survived."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          "Revolution is an inalienable right of mankind. Freedom is an
          imperishable birthright of all."
        </blockquote>
